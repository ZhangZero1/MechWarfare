Matrix Transformations
======================

When transformations are applied the resulting location is the position of the transformed vector in the original coordinate space the object before transformations came from.

So to get the coordinate of an object in a second coordinate space given a vector in the first coordinate space...

1.) pretend the obeject in the first coordinate space is the same coordinate position in the second coordinate space.

2.) translate the second coordinate space into the first coordinate space...
       this lends the pretend position of the object be now trasnlated to its actual position as it belongs

Now the object is in its correct position as it belongs but coordinate is now relative to the second coordinate space
